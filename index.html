        <h2> About Ethan:</h2>
        <p>After initially pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, I discovered my passion for technology while working for Best Buy's Geek Squad, where I specialized in troubleshooting and repairing computers. This hands-on experience sparked my interest in the intricacies of computer systems, leading me to delve into computer engineering at school. However, I realized that traditional education wasn't the ideal path for me. Despite this, my enthusiasm for computers remained strong, prompting me to explore the software aspect of technology. Learning about the Chegg Skills software engineering boot camp, I decided to enroll in the program. A few weeks into the boot camp, I have acquired valuable skills and am thoroughly enjoying the learning process.</p>
        <p>Growing up with a strong athletic background, I have cultivated a passion for sports, including tennis, volleyball, basketball, and various other physical activities. In my leisure time, I also indulge in watching movies and TV shows. My active lifestyle has honed my ability to adapt swiftly to high-pressure situations, a skill that extends beyond the realm of sports. Proficient in hands-on tasks, I am a quick learner and possess a natural aptitude for practical skills. Alongside these attributes, I pride myself on being amicable and an effective people person, fostering positive and collaborative relationships.
</p>
        <p>As a student at Chegg Skills, I am excited to continue my education and expand my skills as a software engineer. I am eager to apply my knowledge and passion for technology to real-world projects.</p>
        <p>Some of my goals by the end of this program are to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Develop a strong foundation in programming and software engineering.</li>
          <li>Create a more detailed and organized portfolio.</li>
          <li>Successfully create projects that I am passionate about.</li>
          <li>Learn how to use Git and GitHub effectively.</li>
          <li>Be able to land a full-time role as a software engineer.</li>
